- Markdoc support is only for `.mdoc` files. This is the thing I guess we are interested in.
- `.astro` are weird JSX-y like js files. Weird.
- `.mdx` files are markdown with react components and js in them. Weirder.
- generate a pdf with `npm run pdf`.
- TypeScript in this project is a PITA tbh
- overall, it feels cleaner and tidier than sphinx and order of mag+ faster, but there's plenty of shit to go wrong and we have to think React sometimes - not necessarily a terrible thing, but a bit eurgh
